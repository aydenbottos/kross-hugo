Hi, my name is Ayden Bottos. I'm a 14-year-old forward-thinking creative hacker with an eye for excellence. I work well in teams and individually. I have experience in mostly everything tech. I'm a perfectionist that does everything to 100%. Currently, I'm building websites while keeping tabs on new tech like AI and Ml. Recently I competed in CyberTaipan, a cybersecurity competition that focusses on defensive cyber measures. I was the Linux expert on my team and pushed us into second place in Australia. I've also been building websites for friends and family. These include Sassy Sprinkles and Escential Perfumes. I also have business experience from my two tech startups, Quixly and Get A Feed. I would love the opportunity to work in mentorship or internship. I'm certain that I would excel at anything thrown at me.
