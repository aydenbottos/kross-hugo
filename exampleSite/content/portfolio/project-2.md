#### Project Details

In this project, I was required to design a beautiful webshop for a perfumery. I used WordPress for the site and WooCommerce for the shop. Part of this project was an advanced manual SQL database migration between incompatible software versions and database format, structure, and design, as well as multiple full site migrations to different hosts using SFTP. I also experimented using AWS Lightsail twice as a host for the website due to a slow hosting package. This involved configuring an email server, extensive DNS setup, and SSL config. The first time, I used OpenLiteSpeed for its performance and the second time NGINX + FastCGI for performance and compatibility.
